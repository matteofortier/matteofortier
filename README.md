Check out my favourite personal projects!

[Steam Games' Genre Multi-Label Classifier](https://github.com/matteofortier/DL_PROJECT) (Deep Learning)

 - Ingested 40,000 games to produce a dataset of 10,000 video game screenshots and 13 labels.  
 - Developed custom tensor generators to support multi-label data and optimisations such as dataset cache-ing.  
 - Implemented image augmentation techniques to reduce overfitting, improving model macro-f1 score by 0.3.  
 - Developed a tailored macro-f1 metric and soft-macro-f1 loss function to score and train multi-label classification.
 - Modelled a CNN video-game genre labeller using TensorFlow and VGG-16 achieving a macro-f1 score of 0.54.

[Recipe Recommender](https://github.com/matteofortier/NLP_PROJECT) (NLP, Unsupervised Learning)

 - Ingested and pre-processed 1 million recipes to extract ingredients using NLTK, SpaCy, and Google Compute Platform. 
 - Designed a topic modelling pipeline using TFIDF vectorizer and NMF to produce 20-100 intuitive topics.  
 - Deployed a web-app using Streamlit that recommends the top 15 most similar recipes given an inputted/selected recipe.

[Steam Game Success Classifier](https://github.com/matteofortier/CLS_PROJECT) (Classification)

 - Produced a dataset of 40,000+ rows with 29 features from disparate sources to use for classification. 
 - Automated tuning of 200 combinations of hyper-parameters using GridSearchCV.  
 - Evaluated the performance of classification models such as XGBoost to achieve AUC of 0.922.

[Twitch Stats Dashboard](https://github.com/matteofortier/ENG_PROJECT) (Data Engineering)

 - Automated data collection from Twitch API to a MongoDB Atlas instance every 30 minutes.  
 - Designed 8 interactive (twitch) data visualisations using Plotly and Dash.  
 - Deployed a web-app on Heroku to allow for quick and easy access to live and historical data about Twitch and Twitch Partners.
